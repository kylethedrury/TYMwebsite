            <p> TYM is currently looking to partner with high schools in the area to help us connect with grade eleven-to-twelve students who could excel at being music teachers for younger children. As someone who personally started teaching at the start of his twelfth-grade year, I understand that this is an excellent way to pad a resume and gain valuable life experience when it comes to interacting with the youth, and imparting knowledge. Schools in any area are welcome to reach out; we are always looking to expand our geographical presence and find new teammates.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> Hi there! My name is Kyle, and I am a third-year honors physics student at McMaster University. I have been teaching piano for the better part of three years, and I have had the privellege of working with dozens of children to help them unlock their musical talent. But as my classes became harder, I found it more difficult to manage things myself. However, the experience that I had was so amazing, that it made me want to share it with other people instead of simply throwing in the towel. So this summer, I started TeamYouthMusic. </p>
